  <h1>goals and why</h1>
  <p>
  I want to live a good life. To have invented something big, or to have contributed to the world in some positive and massive way. I don't want to live an average life. Maybe this is ego speaking, ego saying that I won't be content with being average. But I don't think that's something I can change, it's just something I can accept and adapt to. 
  <br>
  My contribution to the world will likely be in the field of AI. This is just because I think superintelligence is maybe the most important invention, if possible. I want to contribute to this, because it has such high potential to help so many people.
  <br>
  I also want to live a life good for myself. Staying healthy, both mentally and physically. Staying away from distracting technologies like social media, and avoiding most of them, with some exceptions if they provide real value to my life. 
  <br>
  I'd like to retire early and travel the world. This would be from either a successful company or a very good job. Preferably also having someone to share this dream with. The retirement could be partial, I could be working a little but still travelling lots. I'd probably do this to avoid feeling useless.
  <br>
  I want to create things. I'd like stability when I'm retired, I'll have a huge workshop where I make things. 
  <br>
  The way that I act must be in line with these goals though. I can't afford to wait around and act like I'll be handed everything, I have to work for it. These goals are important enough for me that I'm willing to work this hard for it.
