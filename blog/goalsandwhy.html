  <h1>goals and why</h1>
  <p>
  I want to live a good life. To have invented something big, or to have contributed to the world in some positive and massive way. I don't want to live an average life. Maybe this is ego speaking, ego saying that I won't be content with being average. But I don't think that's something I can change, it's just something I can accept and adapt to. 
  <br>
  My contribution to the world be in AI. Mostly because I think it's cool, but also because I think superintelligence could be the most important invention of all time, if possible. I want to contribute to this, because it has such high potential to help so many people. Of course, it is risky and has a big chance of just never happening. But all other inventions had a chance of not happening too, and they happened. I am aware of the negatives of AI, especially the current technologies. I don't want to contribute to the slop machine. I do also realise that most of AI today is just marketing nonsense. This sucks but doesn't undermine the true potential of this technology. 
  <br>
  I want to live a life good for myself and others locally around me. Staying healthy, both mentally and physically. Staying away from distracting technologies like social media, with exceptions if they provide real value to my life. Cultivating good, long-lasting relationships. I'd like to get married at some point, don't mind when.
  <br>
  I'd like to retire early and travel the world. This would be from either a successful company or a very good job. Preferably also having someone to share it with. The retirement could be partial, I could be working a little but still travelling lots. Who knows, I'll just stay adaptable.
  <br>
  I want to create things. I feel like that's what life is all about really.
  <br>
  The way that I act must be in line with these goals though. I can't afford to wait around and act like I'll be handed everything, I have to work for it. These goals are important enough for me that I'm willing to work this hard for it.
  </p>
  <p>I feel like this writing has't had nearly enough thought put into it as something this important should be, I'll rewrite at some point.</p>
