    <h1>Hi</h1>
    <p>
      Not much on here right now, I plan to use this as like a blog where I can just publish my writings and opinions and thoughts on things. Just getting ideas into the world.
      <br>
      Its also mainly as a way to document my process, for lack of a less trite word, my 'journey'.
    </p>
    <h1>Writings</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="blog/goalsandwhy.html">Goals and why</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Cool stuff</h1>
    <p>Stuff that I like. Not necessarily my stuff. I'll put videos and things here.</p>
  </body>
